// common/cluster_participant.h - what a backend must offer to run in a cluster.
//
// The head decorator and the worker loop were written against
// DeepSeek4Backend because it was the only architecture that sharded. Nothing
// they do actually needs that type: they broadcast requests, replay them, and
// hand the backend a config and a communicator. This interface is the whole of
// what they need, so a second architecture can join without either of them
// learning its name.
//
// Attachment happens in two steps, in this order, because the placement must
// exist before the ranks can agree on it and the communicator does not exist
// until they have:
//
//   cluster_attach(&cfg, nullptr)  before init() -- build the rank's placement
//   cluster_attach(&cfg, comm)     after RCCL is up -- attach the transport
//
