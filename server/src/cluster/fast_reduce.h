// fast_reduce.h - a lean all-reduce for the decode path's tiny payloads.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A qwen4exp decode step on two nodes computes in 29.6 ms of
// GPU work and takes 41.0. The difference is ninety-seven all-reduces of
// 10 KiB each -- 117 us apiece. That is not the wire: ib_write_lat puts the
// same payload at 13.65 us, and the round trip through a pinned flag between
// the GPU and a host thread measures 0.79 us. It is what a general-purpose
// collective costs per call, ninety-seven times, and it is the single reason
// adding ranks to this model buys nothing: every axis worth sharding pays for
// its bytes with reductions at about 11.9 MB each, and every axis this model
// has sits on that line.
//
// So this replaces the collective for exactly the case it is bad at: a few
// kilobytes, latency-bound, on the critical path of every layer. Each rank
// writes its partial straight into every peer's pre-registered buffer and adds
// what arrives. There is no algorithm selection, no protocol negotiation and
// no proxy handshake -- one RDMA write per peer and a flag.
//
// WHAT IT ASSUMES. Unified memory. On Strix Halo there is no separate VRAM, so
// a pinned host buffer *is* GPU memory: the NIC writes into it and a kernel
// reads it without a copy and without GPUDirect. It also assumes the ranks run
// the same graph in lockstep, so that the n-th reduction on one rank is the
// n-th on all of them -- which is what the sequence numbers check rather than
// trust.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a general collective: sum of f32, small sizes, no
// in-place aliasing games, no groups. Anything outside that keeps using RCCL.
//
